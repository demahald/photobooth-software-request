# Looking for a developer to build a custom Photobooth Software

I’m looking for a developer to create a full photobooth software that includes:

### Requirements:
- Connect DSLR or mirrorless camera (live view + capture)
- Trigger external flash
- Connect and print automatically on a photo printer (DNP or similar)
- UI with 6–8 screens (Start, Payment, Countdown, Pose screen, Result, Print)
- Template/border system
- Two copies printing
- Touch screen support
- Integration with KNET payment (Kuwait)

### Flow:
Start → Payment → Countdown → Capture → Preview → Print

### Platform:
Windows or Linux.

If you're experienced in camera SDKs, printing APIs and payment integration, contact me.
